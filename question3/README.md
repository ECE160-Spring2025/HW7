# Question 3

Using the point struct that we used in class, write a program that will compute 11 points of a quadratic curve in the form of ax^2+bx+c from -5 to 5. Prompt the user to input values for a, b, and c. Store these points in a struct array and print the points.

Have the main accept a, b, and c (which are whole numbers to make things easier) using argc and argv.

Compile Steps:

Output:
