## Question 1

Write a function that determines the maximum and minimum values from a one-dimensional array. Assume that the corresponding function prototype statement is

<code>void ranges(int x[], int npts, int *max_ptr, int *min_ptr)</code>

where npts contain the number of values in array x, and max_ptr and min_ptr are pointers to the variables in which to store the maximum and minimum values in the array.

Have a main that first accept the number of points followed by an array of integers (max 10). Your main should also print out the max and min values of the array after calling the ranges function.

Output:
